# blackjack-game
The Player starts with a value of $100 in the text file Bank. The game creates a classic game of blackjack where the player can only hit or stand. The Dealer will go up to 
a card value of 17 or more then stand. Then the game will compare the value between the Player and the Dealer and resolve the bet appropriately. Money is substracted or added 
from the Bank text file so that the Player's net worth is persistant between runs.
